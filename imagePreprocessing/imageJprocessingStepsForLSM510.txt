For DIC images masked with thresholded IRM and spot images: 

Do manual thresholding of the spot image; Apply mask; Fill holes; Dilate 6 times (7 for memory datasets).

IRM processing: 
Remove outliers (20 pixel radius; above 40)
Apply FFT bandpass filter (down to 40, upto 3, autoscaling with saturation)
Default Threshold algorithm (calculate threshold for each slice separately); Apply mask
Fill holes; Dilate 3 times

Image calculator: AND on both mask images; take the 'overlap', fill holes; then apply that as a mask (another AND operation) on the DIC channel.

Filling the background: Math->Macro-> if(v==0){v=80;} 
The actual background fill value is decided based on checking the specific dataset.

For image series containing DIC, IRM and flourescence information

IRM processing: 
Remove outliers 20 pixel radius; above 5 (bright pixels)
Enhance contrast: 0% saturated, normalize, 
Remove outliers: 20 pixel radius, threshold 10

Spot image processing: 
Enhance contrast: 0% saturated, normalize
Median filtering (pixel radius 2)
New blank image (with 360 slices); Image calculator (blank image series + processed spots image)
