datacell description for vivek:
------------------------------------------

The datacell is a 1 dimensional matlab cell array, where each element is a matrix that holds data relevant to a single cell-track (I'll refer to these as a cell-track-matrices). Each cell-track-matrix has a number of columns:

1:  startframe *
2:  endframe *
3:  x position
4:  y position
5:  irm attachment area
6:  fluor channel 1 value
7:  fluor channel 2 value
8:  fluor / cell-type classification *
9:  step 1 speed
10:  step 4 speed
11:  step 8 speed
12:  normalized displacement *
13:  displacement *
14:  arrest coefficient *
15:  turn angle
16:  corrected confinement index *
17-40:  outline
41:  polarity

* asterisk means the value is the same for all rows


Columns in the datacell become populated when functions such as get_speed, get_irm, get_fluor, etc., are called. Each of these functions returns a datacell with the designated column values added for each cell-track-matrix in the datacell.
